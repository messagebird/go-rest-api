// Package conversation provides an interface to the Conversations API. The
// API's docs are located here:
// https://developers.messagebird.com/docs/conversations. The api.go file
// contains the structs returned by the API, and the other files provide the
// functionality needed to send requests, as well as any structs required for
// that - e.g. request data or pagination options.
//
// @todo Write docs, mostly on HSM.
// @todo Consider moving struct defs from api.go to separate files - or
//       reorder them in a more logical way.
